                            Preamble

 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works.

 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
 the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
 to share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains
 free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation,
 use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies
 also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply
 it to your programs, too.
